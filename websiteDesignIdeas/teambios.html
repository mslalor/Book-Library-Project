        <h2>Kaleigh Andrzejewski</h2>
        <p>I am a senior computer science major with a mathematics minor and am originally from Buffalo, NY.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I am currently in the Accelerated Master's Program for a Master's in computer science
            and hope to work in medical technology/software after graduation.</p>
        <p>I have prior experience with JavaScript and some database work and look forward to the process of completing this
            project!</p>

        <h2>Angela Gardner</h2>
        <p>I am in my final semester of computer science and will move on to getting my MBA with a concentration in business
            analytics.</p>
        <p>I would love to do analytics for a larger tech company when I graduate, preferably on the east coast.</p>
        <p>I work with databases almost every day at the University's IDA, so I am interested in using that knowledge with
            the JavaScript skills that I have. I hope to learn a lot about website development and their database(s).</p>

        <h2>Mikayla Kantorski</h2>
        <p>I am a senior majoring in computer science. I grew up in Wauconda, IL, in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago.</p>
        <p>Although I don't have too much experience with the front end, it interests me as I've always had a more creative
            side. My goal is to work with mobile app development.</p>
        <p>I'm hoping to dig deeper into the front end with this project and am excited to learn how to develop a full stack
            application.</p>
