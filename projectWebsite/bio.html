<h2>Angela Gardner</h2> 
<p>I am in my final semester of computer science and will move on to getting my MBA with a concentration in business analytics. </p>
<p>I would love to do analytics for a larger tech company when I graduate, preferably on the east coast.</p>
<p>   I work with databases almost every day at the University's IDA, so I am interested in using that knowledge with
      the JavaScript skills that I have. I hope to learn a lot about website development and their database(s).
