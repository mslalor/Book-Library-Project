<h2>Angela Gardner</h2> 
<p>I am in my final semester of computer science and will move on to getting my MBA with a concentration in business analytics. </p>
<p>I would love to do analytics for a larger tech company when I graduate, preferably on the east coast.</p>
<p>   I work with databases almost every day at the University's IDA, so I am interested in using that knowledge with
      the JavaScript skills that I have. I hope to learn a lot about website development and their database(s).

<h2>Mikayla Kantorski</h2>
<p>I am a senior majoring in computer science. I grew up in Wauconda, IL, in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago. </p>
<p>Although I don't have too much experience with the front end, it interests me as I've always had a more creative side. My goal is to work with mobile app development. </p>
<p>I'm hoping to dig deeper into the front end with this project and am excited to learn how to develop a full stack application.</p>
