<p>    How to execute our website:</p>
<p>    The first page you are directed to is the login page to sign into your account (called login.html). </p>
<p>   The database has not currently been setup, meaning that there are no real accounts stored yet. </p>
<p>   A fake account for login purposes is </p>
<p>   username: kaleigh@gmail.com </p>
<p>   password: password </p>
    
<p>   To register for an account, click "Sign up here!" which will take you to the registration page (registration.html). </p>
<p>   To return to the log in page, click "Login now". </p>
    
<p>   After entering your login and clicking "Login", you are taken to your dashboard page (dashboard.html). </p>
<p>   Here, users are able to view their personal library, add/edit books and edit the book's status. </p>
<p>   If a book has been lent out, select "Lend this book?". </p>
<p>   This will change the button to "Returned?" which can be selected when the book has been returned. </p>
<p>   Users can filter at the top of the screen by all their books, books that have been lent out, and books that have not been lent out and are currently in their library. </p>
    
<p>   Selecting "Add New Book" on the side bar takes users down to the section where they will be able to add a new book to their libary.</p>
<p>   Selecting "Library" on the side bar takes users back up to the top of their library.</p>
<p>   Selecting "Sign out" on the side bar takes users back to the log in page and signs them out of their account.</p>
